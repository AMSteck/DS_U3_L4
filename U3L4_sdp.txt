1. when len(searchList) == 1 or middle == target

2. target is the thing were trying to find. sorted list in the list that we check for the target and sort if its not in the middle.  pointer
tracks the index of the target number if its in there at all

3. inital value = 0. if its to the left it wont change. If its to the right it will go one right to the middle item in the current list before its split again.

4. one by one it would take 9 times at most to get a result. recursion only has to run 3 times at most
